The 4-print_square module contains a print_square function that prints a square with the # character. The function takes an integer size as input, which is the side length of the square to be printed.

The provided test cases are:

Creating a square of size 5 and printing it.
Passing 0 as the size of the square.
Passing a float as the size of the square.
Passing a string as the size of the square.
Passing a negative integer as the size of the square.
Passing None as the size of the square.
Missing the size argument when calling the function.
All of the test cases are testing the function's behavior when the input size parameter is invalid. The function raises a TypeError if the size is not an integer or a ValueError if the size is a negative integer.

The first test case verifies that the function prints a square of size 5 correctly. The second test case checks that the function raises a ValueError when passed 0 as the size of the square. The third test case checks that the function raises a TypeError when passed a float as the size of the square. The fourth test case checks that the function raises a TypeError when passed a string as the size of the square. The fifth test case checks that the function raises a ValueError when passed a negative integer as the size of the square. The sixth test case checks that the function raises a TypeError when passed None as the size of the square. The last test case checks that the function raises a TypeError when called without the size argument.

Overall, the test cases are comprehensive and cover all possible edge cases. The implementation seems to work correctly for the given requirements.
